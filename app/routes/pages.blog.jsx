                <p>Creatine is a widely used supplement known for its ability to enhance athletic performance and muscle growth. By increasing ATP production, creatine improves strength, power, and exercise performance, particularly during high-intensity activities. It may also aid in muscle recovery, reduce fatigue, and offer cognitive benefits. </p>
                <div> <p>Typically taken in a loading phase of 20g/day for 5-7 days followed by a maintenance phase of 3-5g/day, creatine is generally safe but may cause mild side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort. When used alongside proper training and nutrition, creatine can be a valuable tool for athletes seeking to optimize their performance and muscle gains. Consulting a healthcare professional before starting supplementation is advisable.</p></div>
